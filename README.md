# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It is designed to showcase my **skills, projects, about me, and contact information** in a structured, visually appealing, and responsive way. The site focuses on clean layouts, card-based designs, and smooth user interactions.  

## Features

- **Home Page:** Introduces me with a profile image, name, and a short overview. The layout uses **CSS Flexbox** for alignment and spacing, with a gradient background for a modern look.  
- **Skills Page:** Highlights technical and soft skills in **responsive cards**, using **CSS box shadows, border-radius, and padding** for an organized presentation.  
- **Projects Page:** Each project is displayed in a **card layout** with descriptions, hover effects, and shadows. **Horizontal scrolling** is implemented for smaller screens using **CSS overflow-x**.  
- **About Page:** Contains my bio, interests, and strengths in structured containers and cards. Styled using **CSS flexbox, spacing, and typography** for readability and visual appeal.  
- **Contact Page:** Shows my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links in a neat card layout. **Hover effects** and consistent styling ensure it aligns with the overall design of the website.  

The site is built using **semantic HTML** for clean structure and **CSS3** for styling, including:  
- Flexbox for alignment and responsive layouts  
- Gradients for background styling  
- Box shadows and rounded corners for card effects  
- Hover transitions for interactive elements
